## Where AI Was Used

### ✅ Code Scaffolding
- Initial boilerplate for Streamlit UI
- WebSocket ingestion patterns
- Analytics engine structure

### ✅ Debugging Assistance
- Identifying UI duplication issues
- Fixing Streamlit rerun patterns
- Resolving widget key conflicts

### ✅ Documentation
- README.md structure
- Code comments
- Architecture diagrams

### ✅ Code Review
- 15-point Streamlit audit
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Production-readiness checks

## What Remained Human

### 🧠 Architectural Decisions
- Multi-pair isolation design
- File-based state exchange pattern
- Version-lock rendering strategy

### 🧠 Business Logic
- Statistical arbitrage formulas
- ADF test parameters
- Half-life computation methodology

### 🧠 Testing & Validation
- Manual UI testing
- Performance verification
- Edge case identification

### 🧠 Final Review
- All AI suggestions reviewed and validated
- Code ownership remains with the developer

## Philosophy

AI was used as a **productivity multiplier**, not a replacement for engineering judgment. Every suggestion was:

1. Understood before implementation
2. Tested after implementation
3. Validated against requirements

The final codebase represents human decision-making augmented by AI efficiency.

## Transparency

This disclosure is provided in the spirit of transparency for technical evaluation purposes. AI assistance is a standard practice in modern software development and does not diminish the technical merit of the work.
